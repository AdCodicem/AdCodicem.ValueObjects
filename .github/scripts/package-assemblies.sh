# Extracts every assembly the packages ship, so that the provenance attestation
# can name them as subjects next to the .nupkg and .snupkg files.
#
# Usage: package-assemblies.sh <packages-dir> <output-dir>
#
# nuget.org adds its repository signature (.signature.p7s) to every .nupkg it
# accepts, so the copy a user restores no longer has the digest that was
# attested. The entries inside are left byte for byte as packed, though, and
# NuGet extracts them unchanged into the global packages folder: attesting the
# assemblies is what makes a restored DLL verifiable with
#   gh attestation verify ~/.nuget/packages/<id>/<version>/lib/net10.0/<id>.dll \
#     --repo AdCodicem/AdCodicem.ValueObjects
# Each package is extracted into a directory of its own, so that two packages
# shipping an assembly of the same name never overwrite each other.
