#                                   what preview.yml does: mode=publish, repair or none.
#                                   NEXT_VERSION and RELEASE_TYPE are what next-version.mjs computed

#        preview-gate.sh --report   for release.yml: warns when HEAD carries package inputs that
#                                   no version on nuget.org carries, so no preview did, and when
#                                   the version it compares with is on some packages only

#                                   unless the base nuget.org gives GATE_REF is still the one the
#                                   plan saw, or the version being published (a push of this very
#                                   run that stopped midway). A re-run of an old run, after a newer
#                                   commit was published, stops there. Needs neither dotnet nor a
#                                   restore: the IDs come from PACKAGE_IDS.
#
# The base is a version on nuget.org and the commit it was packed from, read off its nuspec
# (<repository commit="..."/>, which SourceLink writes): of the versions from the last stable tag
# merged into HEAD on, across every package ID, the one packed from the commit nearest to HEAD.
# Not the previous run of the workflow: a run can stop after part of its push, a stable release
# publishes too, and nuget.org is the one record that survives both.
#
#   repair   a package the base commit packed lacks the base version: a push stopped midway.
#            nuget.org has no transaction, so the missing IDs are completed at that version, from
#            that commit, before anything newer is published.
#   publish  a package input changed between the base commit and HEAD.
#   none     nothing a package is built from changed.
