#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Pushes to nuget.org whatever of this version it does not have yet, dependencies
# first, and optionally waits until nuget.org serves all of it.
#
# Usage: push-packages.sh <packages-dir> <version>
# Needs NUGET_API_KEY (the short-lived key NuGet/login exchanged for the job's
# OIDC token).
#   NUGET_PUSH_ATTEMPTS   passes over the set before giving up (default 3)
#   NUGET_PUSH_BACKOFF    seconds before the second pass, doubled for each later one (default 60)
#   NUGET_LIST_TIMEOUT    seconds to wait, once everything is pushed, until nuget.org
#                         lists every package and serves every symbol package; 0, the
#                         default, does not wait. preview.yml waits, so that the next
#                         run decides from a nuget.org that has caught up.
#   NUGET_SOURCE, NUGET_FLAT_CONTAINER, NUGET_SYMBOL_PACKAGES override the endpoints.
#
# nuget.org has no transaction: a push of fourteen packages is fourteen requests, and
# a run that stops halfway leaves some of them published. So the set is pushed in
# dependency order -- AdCodicem.ValueObjects.Abstractions before everything that
# depends on it -- and a pass stops at the first package that fails, so that
# whatever a partial push leaves on nuget.org can be restored: no package is ever
# published before one it depends on. Each pass asks nuget.org which packages
# already carry the version and pushes only the others, so the same script, run
# again in the same job, by "Re-run failed jobs", or by preview.yml's next run
# (repair), completes the set at the same version. release.yml runs it as
# semantic-release's publish step, where a re-run finds the release already
# tagged: a stable set left partial is completed by running it again by hand on
# the release's packages.
#
# Each .nupkg is pushed with --no-symbols, and its .snupkg by a push of its own
# right after it. Pushed together, a .nupkg answering 409 would take its symbols
# down with it: --skip-duplicate never sends the symbols of a package it skips,
# and a .nupkg that nuget.org holds but does not list yet answers 409, after an
# earlier pass or after the client's own retry of a request that timed out or
# answered 5xx. A package nuget.org already lists, whose symbols it does not
# serve, gets its .snupkg pushed on its own. A .snupkg still validating answers
# 409, which is skipped. A symbol package that fails does not stop the pass,
# since no package needs the symbols of another, but fails it once every package
# is pushed. preview-gate.sh only completes missing .nupkg files, so a symbol
# package still missing after the wait fails the job, and "Re-run failed jobs"
# pushes it.
#
# Every lookup is a plain statement whose failure returns from the pass
# explicitly: inside a function called from a condition, bash suspends set -e,
# and a failed lookup would otherwise read as "missing" and push.
